# Title of the Project : Clustering Analysis of Fast Food Nutrition Dataset 
# Description : 
This project involves the application of clustering techniques on the Fast Food Nutrition dataset to identify patterns based on nutritional factors such as calories, total fat, and trans fat. Various data embedding methods (PCA, UMAP, MDS, IsoMAP, Spectral Embedding, t-SNE) were explored to reduce the data's dimensionality, followed by clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering) to find meaningful clusters. The project also involves visualization and analysis of cluster memberships to extract insights.
# Goals :
•	 Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, scale numeric variables, and apply power transformations.

•	Data Embeddings: Use PCA, UMAP, MDS, IsoMAP, Spectral Embedding, and t-SNE to visualize the data in lower dimensions.

•	 Clustering: Apply K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering to the embedded data.

•	        Cluster Analysis: Evaluate clustering solutions and analyze cluster memberships to determine the best model.
