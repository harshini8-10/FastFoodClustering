# FastFoodClustering
This project applies clustering techniques to the Fast Food Nutrition dataset to group food items based on their nutritional content. Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) and clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering) are used to identify and analyze patterns.
